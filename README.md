place the Ortholog_Checker folder in C:\
requires PATH installation of NCBI BLAST+ (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/)
hopefully the ortholog_checker.exe will be executable from anywhere, but probably only on windows.
alternatively, directly run the python file, which requires the packages Biopython, re, Pandas, and subprocess
